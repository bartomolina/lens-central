- 🥇 On-chain activity remains three times higher than that of Momoka, which is determined on a user-by-user basis rather than by the app itself. From a month ago, it seems that no new users are being migrated to Momoka
- 🏦 The introduction of Momoka has decreased the fees paid by the dispatchers more than 90% (from $40k to $4k daily)
- 💸 There was a huge spike in February when the dispatchers had to assume more than $400k in fees per day and the network activity and gas price increased significantly. This was mainly caused by the activity of profiles (NFTs) and reinforces the need for the introduction of Momoka, and will likely lead to reconsider treating the followings as NFTs in the future
